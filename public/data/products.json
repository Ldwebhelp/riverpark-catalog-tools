A minimum tank size of 20 gallons per axolotl is recommended.</li> <li>Provide hiding spots with rocks, caves, and aquatic plants like Java Moss or Anubias. Avoid gravel substrate as axolotls can ingest it, leading to health issues.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water Parameters</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Keep the water temperature cool, ideally between 16 to 20&deg;C (60 to 68&deg;F).</li> <li>Maintain good water quality with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and low ammonia and nitrate levels.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Filtration and Water Flow</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid strong water currents as axolotls are poor swimmers. Use a gentle filtration system to maintain water quality without creating strong currents.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diet</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Feed Leucistic Axolotls a diet primarily consisting of live or frozen foods like bloodworms, blackworms, brine shrimp, and earthworms.</li> <li>Offer occasional treats of high-quality axolotl pellets or sinking carnivore pellets.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tank mates</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Axolotls are best kept alone or with their own kind to prevent potential aggression or stress.</li> <li>Do not house axolotls with fast-moving or nippy fish as they may mistake their appendages for food and attempt to bite them.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Behavior and Compatibility</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Leucistic Axolotls are primarily nocturnal and may become stressed in brightly lit tanks. Provide subdued lighting and plenty of hiding places to make them feel secure.</li> <li>They are generally peaceful towards tank mates of appropriate size and temperament but should be monitored for any signs of aggression.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>",

Beardie Life contains a mixture of sand and soil to create a realistic looking and feeling substrate which encourages natural behaviour, such as digging and foraging, and which aids the maintenance of a suitable environment. The addition of soil to the mixture reduces the risk of impaction sometimes seen with pure sand, while enhancing the moisture retention ability of the substrate.",

A minimum tank size of 20 gallons per axolotl is recommended.</li> <li>Provide hiding spots with rocks, caves, and aquatic plants like Java Moss or Anubias. Avoid gravel substrate as axolotls can ingest it, leading to health issues.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water Parameters</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Keep the water temperature cool, ideally between 16 to 20&deg;C (60 to 68&deg;F).</li> <li>Maintain good water quality with a pH range of 6.5 to 7.5 and low ammonia and nitrate levels.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Filtration and Water Flow</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid strong water currents as axolotls are poor swimmers. Use a gentle filtration system to maintain water quality without creating strong currents.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diet</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Feed Axolotls a diet primarily consisting of live or frozen foods like bloodworms, blackworms, brine shrimp, and earthworms.</li> <li>Offer occasional treats of high-quality axolotl pellets or sinking carnivore pellets.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tank mates</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Axolotls are best kept alone or with their own kind to prevent potential aggression or stress.</li> <li>Do not house axolotls with fast-moving or nippy fish as they may mistake their appendages for food and attempt to bite them.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Behavior and Compatibility</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Axolotls are primarily nocturnal and may become stressed in brightly lit tanks. Provide subdued lighting and plenty of hiding places to make them feel secure.</li> <li>They are generally peaceful towards tank mates of appropriate size and temperament but should be monitored for any signs of aggression.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>",

The Aquarium Lab Multi-Test Kit comprises up to 200 tests combined of the 6 key parameters to test in your aquarium: ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, GH and KH. All the tests are liquid drop tests from a dropper bottle so all the drops are the same size. Full instructions are included detailing optimum levels and suggestions for correction, along with an integrated test tube rack. All you have to do is add your aquarium water to the test tube and count the drops needed. The back of the box details clear pictorial instructions so you can see what to do from the start. A set of colour coded stickers is provided to label both the test tubes and test tube lids so you always conduct the same test in the same test tube avoiding contamination.</p>",

Matrix&trade; is a porous inorganic solid about 10 mm in diameter. Each litre of Matrix&trade; provides as much surface (&gt;~700 m2) as 170 litres of plastic balls! Plastic bio-materials provide only external surface area, whereas Matrix&trade; provides both external and internal macroporous surface area. These macropores are ideally sized for the support of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. This allows Matrix&trade;, unlike other forms of biomedia, to remove nitrate along with ammonia and nitrite, simultaneously and in the same filter.</p> <p>Matrix&trade; is completely inert and will not breakdown. It need not be replaced. Since the majority of the bacteria are internal, Matrix&trade; may be rinsed when needed without damaging the filter. Matrix&trade; is compatible with all types of wet or wet-dry filters.</p> <p>Sizes: 250 mL, 500 mL, 1 L, 2 L, 4 L</p>",

Its appearance is best suited to planted aquaria, but may be used in any freshwater aquarium environment. Flourite Black is most effective when used alone as an integral substrate bed, but it may be mixed with other gravels. Gravel modifiers such as laterite are not necessary. Flourite Black is not chemically coated or treated and will not alter the pH of the water. Flourite Black is good for the life of the aquarium and need not be replaced.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Overflow filters are made up of a&nbsp;suction pump tank or buzzer. The water sucked in from the aquarium passes through the filtering substances, and then through the outlet tube is poured back into the aquarium.</p> <p>VERSAMAX consists of a&nbsp;filter cover, an overflow unit, a&nbsp;container for filter media with a&nbsp;sponge cartridge. It is airtight and completely safe. Installation does not pose too many problems &ndash; just hang it on the wall of the aquarium. It purifies and aerates water, and its high efficiency ensures its intensive filtration.</p> <h3>Specification</h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"width: 358px;\">&nbsp;</td> <td style=\"min-width: 101px;

    "description": "<p>Overflow filters are made up of a&nbsp;suction pump tank or buzzer. The water sucked in from the aquarium passes through the filtering substances, and then through the outlet tube is poured back into the aquarium.</p> <p>VERSAMAX consists of a&nbsp;filter cover, an overflow unit, a&nbsp;container for filter media with a&nbsp;sponge cartridge. It is airtight and completely safe. Installation does not pose too many problems &ndash; just hang it on the wall of the aquarium. It purifies and aerates water, and its high efficiency ensures its intensive filtration.</p> <h3>Specification</h3> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td style=\"width: 358px;\">&nbsp;</td> <td style=\"min-width: 101px;

    "description": "<p>Pond aeration is an essential part of a successful pond. Pond Oxygenator pumps are able to run numerous air stones at any one time, creating a healthy oxygen rich pond that will benefit your fish and biological filter bacteria. Your Pond Oxygenator pump is both cost effective to run, as it is low wattage design, and can be maintained with excellent value maintenance parts. Fish and other pond life require oxygen rich water in order to remain healthy, filter bacteria -essential to the breakdown of highly toxic ammonia and nitrate - also require oxygen to flourish, and keep the pond free from the build up of toxic waste. Use of an air pump will dramatically increase the level of oxygen in the pond and reduce carbon dioxide levels, thus aiding in preventing the pond from stagnating by injecting air into the water. Additionally, by placing air stones directly into the filter chambers, beneficial bacteria, essential to the well being of a pond, will be encouraged to grow, which in turn will greatly improve filter efficiency and fish health. This replaces previous Koi Air 25 air pump.</p> <ul> <li>Specifically designed for water garden application</li> <li>Creates powerful aeration and circulation</li> <li>Able to run multiple air stones at a time</li> <li>Dramatically increases the level of oxygen in the water</li> <li>Prevents pond stagnating</li> <li>Can be used for aquarium application - great in a fish house</li> </ul> <table> <tbody> <tr> <th>Product code</th> <td class=\"sku\">1010825</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Product barcode</th> <td class=\"UPC_Code\">5015368010825</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Disposal of electrical goods</th> <td class=\"WEEE\">Y</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Size</th> <td class=\"Size\">(d) Large Pond</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Wattage</th> <td class=\"Wattage\">16w</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Flow rate</th> <td class=\"Flow_Rate\">1800 ltr/hr</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Outlets</th> <td class=\"Outlets\">6</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Spare Parts</th> <td class=\"Spares\"> <ul> <li>50mm Air stones Annual service kit - 1057356 10 outlet metal valve with adapter - 1057387 18 Outlet metal valve with adapter - 1057394</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr> <th>Mains cable length</th> <td class=\"Cable_length_Mains\">5m</td> </tr> <tr> <th>Plug included</th> <td class=\"Plug\">No. In the UK it is illegal for manufacturers to supply an indoor use 3-pin plug with a fixed outdoor product for safety reasons.

Pond Oxygenator pumps are able to run numerous air stones at any one time, creating a healthy oxygen rich pond that will benefit your fish and biological filter bacteria. Your Pond Oxygenator pump is both cost effective to run, as it is low wattage design, and can be maintained with excellent value maintenance parts. Fish and other pond life require oxygen rich water in order to remain healthy, filter bacteria -essential to the breakdown of highly toxic ammonia and nitrate - also require oxygen to flourish, and keep the pond free from the build up of toxic waste.

A sensor changes reversibly from yellow to green to blue, relative to the ammonia concentration. No test kits, chemicals, or procedures are needed.

As free ammonia, the ALERT color corresponds to about 0.05 mg/L, ALARM to about 0.2 mg/L, and TOXIC to about 0.5 mg/L. Administering a water change should be considered for any indication other than SAFE. The ALERT concentration is tolerated for 3-5 days, ALARM for 1-3 days, and TOXIC is rapidly harmful, requiring immediate attention.

Avoid touching the sensor with fingers, since skin oils can damage it. Do not use bleach, soap, detergents or hard objects to clean the sensor. Some dye medications may discolor the sensor. Sensitivity improves with age, provided the unit is not allowed to dry out, however, drying does not permanently impair the unit. For maximum sensitivity, the unit should be read under natural daylight or daylight simulating light. Red enhancing light minimizes green and blue hues, decreasing the apparent sensitivity of the unit. The response of the unit may be checked by holding it briefly over the mouth of an ammonia bottle: color should develop rapidly.</p> <h3 class=\"pb-lg\">pH Alert</h3> <h4>Care</h4> <p>No care is required beyond removing algae with a clean, soft material.

It is not very demanding, but appreciates a nutritious substrate and good light. Like many other Cryptocorynes it needs to acclimatize before growth starts in earnest. Leaves becomes 20-60 cm long and the single roset plant becomes 15-20 cm wide. Place it in the rear part of the tank, from where the leaves may float beautifully on the water surface. The leaves are either entirely green or maroon.</p>",

The growth is low and dense, as the plant branches willingly, even without trimming. In addition, the mini version rarely forms the long vertical shoots which otherwise characterize Lobelia cardinalis. It is easily propagated by planting the cut shoots down into the bottom layer.

    "description": "<p>Bio active substrates are designed to allow the maintenance of living ecosystems inside the terrarium. ProRep Bio-Life substrate is carefully blended from a mixture of ingredients to provide the optimum combination of structure, PH and nutrient content for plants from arid environments. When used in a planted terrarium, a living ecosystem can be created where the terrarium occupants co-exist with the plants and microorganisms to create a self-sustaining ecosystem. The microorganisms digest waste material, which is in turn taken up by the plants for growth, locking away harmful nitrogen while creating a living, natural habitat. Because an arid environment set up is dry, with low humidity, then it can be more difficult to maintain than forest set ups. With the proper design however, it is possible to recreate a moist zone in the base of the terrarium to mimic the moisture commonly found underground in deserts. This moist zone provides a reservoir of water which plants and microorganisms can access, while the surface of the substrate remains dry.</p>",

Used in the base of bio-active terrariums it creates a reservoir of water which moistens the substrate from below and helps to create a natural moisture gradient.

Leo Life contains a mixture of sand and soil to create a realistic looking and feeling substrate which encourages natural behaviour, such as digging and foraging, and aids the maintenance of a suitable environment. The addition of soil to the mixture reduces the risk of impaction sometimes seen with pure sand, while enhancing the moisture retention ability of the substrate.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Coarse 5 Litre Vermiculite ProRep Vermiculite can be used as a substrate for spiders or as an incubation medium for reptile eggs. A 100% natural substrate made from exfoliated volcanic rock, it is inert and will not decay or go mouldy. Directions: Place the required amount of Vermiculite in a clean container. Add cold water a little at a time until the correct moisture content is reached. Nominal Particle Size 3-15mm For use with spiders, place a 1-2&rdquo; (2.5-5cm) layer of moistened Vermiculite in the bottom of the tank. This substrate is not recommended for burrowing species as it does not form burrows easily &ndash; for these species use Spider Life Substrate. Spot-clean regularly and change completely every 4 weeks, or sooner if required. For use as an incubation medium place a thick layer of moistened Vermiculite in the incubation box. A moisture ratio of 2:1 Vermiculite to water by weight is suitable for many species but some species have different requirements. Carefully place the eggs in the Vermiculite with the top third of the egg exposed. When moving the eggs from the egg laying site to the Vermiculite take care to keep them the same way up. If possible ensure that the eggs do not touch each other during incubation. Please note that as incubation of reptile eggs is a complex process that varies from species to species, it is essential that you research the details for each species before eggs are laid and have a suitable incubator ready.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Pro Rep Bio Life Leaf Litter Jungle is perfect for creating a secure hiding layer for animals such snakes, lizards, frogs, and salamanders. Simply add as decoration to the top layer of substrate to help create a natural forest environment. An essential addition to replicate the &lsquo;litter layer&rsquo; within a bioactive enclosure. <br />The litter layer as well as providing security, aids in maintaining atmospheric and substrate moisture/humidity levels and most importantly it will provide the environment in which beneficial bacteria, fungi, and custodian insects such as springtails and wood lice will thrive and play their important role in your bioactive enclosure. In the &lsquo;litter layer&rsquo; Bio Life Leaf litter Jungle will break down and be consumed providing much needed food to your plant life. <br />The litter layer within your enclosure should be at least 3-4cm deep but can be much deeper should you want to. The litter layer found in the natural habitat of many of the animals we keep will be 24-30cm at least. To create your starter litter layer, break up the leaf litter in your hands and scatter the fine pieces on top of a suitable substrate such as Pro Rep Bio Life Forest substrate to at least a 1cm depth. Give this a good spray to keep the layer in place. After this a layer of unbroken leaf litter can then be added. The fine layer will be broken down quicker and provide a layer for the custodians to hide, preventing them being quickly eaten by terrestrial inhabitants such as dart frogs. The unbroken layer will then provide cover and hiding places for your animals. A new layer of leaf litter should be added as the litter breaks down and is consumed at least every 4-6 months or when necessary. Ideally your &lsquo;litter layer&rsquo; should be started at least 3-4 weeks before introducing your chosen species, but it is still possible to carry out this process with them already in the enclosure. <br />Pro Rep Bio Life Leaf Litter Jungle contains a mix of leaves such as, Cashew, Coffee, Cinnamon, Guava, Durian, Jack Fruit, Ketakera, Mahogany, Mangrove, Mango, and Mangus. Gathered from sustainable sources. Pro Rep Bio Life Leaf Litter Jungle is a natural product and may contain stalks and twigs.</p>",

    "description": "<p>A compressed brick of broken leaf litter to help establish the intricate layers typically found in forests and jungles. Leaf litter in forests plays a crucial role in supporting the intricate web of life within these ecosystems. As fallen leaves accumulate on the forest floor, they create a diverse and nutrient-rich microhabitat that shelters and nourishes countless animal species. This natural carpet of decomposing leaves provides shelter for insects, amphibians, and reptiles, offering protection from predators and environmental extremes. Additionally, the decomposition of leaf litter enriches the soil with essential nutrients, creating a foundation for plant growth that sustains small detritivores such as woodlice, millipedes, and springtails. Leaf litter serves as a fundamental building block of forest biodiversity, fostering interconnected relationships that contribute to the overall health and vitality of these intricate ecosystems. When combined with other soil-based substrates and larger leaf litter, the leaf litter brick helps establish the bio-diverse layers typically found in forest habitats.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Usage: ProRep Calci Dust is a supplement for reptiles and amphibians. It is made from 100% natural calcium carbonate with no additives and is an excellent way to provide essential calcium and avoid deficiency diseases. It&rsquo;s micro-fine particle size ensures excellent adhesion to both live insects and plant material. Directions: Calcium forms an essential part of the diet of all reptiles and amphibians. Many foods that are used to feed them in captivity are low in this essential mineral or may have high levels of Phosphorus, which can inhibit the uptake of calcium. To supplement vegetable matter for tortoises and other herbivorous reptiles simply sprinkle over food immediately before feeding. To supplement insects then place a small amount in a plastic bag with the insects and shake gently. They should then be fed immediately while the Calci Dust is still stuck to the insects. To aid feeding the insects can be cooled before applying the Calci Dust. This will make them slower and ensure that they are quickly eaten. It is not possible to overdose using Calci Dust and it can be used to supplement at every feed. However, as some animals find large quantities of it unpalatable avoid smothering the food. Because this product is 100% calcium carbonate, large quantities are not required to provide adequate calcium levels. If acceptance is a problem then start with very low levels of supplementation and gradually increase it until your animals are used to the taste. Most reptiles and amphibians can only absorb calcium from their food in the presence of vitamin D3. It is essential that adequate UVB light of the correct wavelength and intensity is provided to enable D3 synthesis by the animal or that oral D3 is supplied. It is recommended that a vitamin/mineral supplement is also used in conjunction with Calci Dust. Contents: Calcium carbonate Precautions: Not for human consumption. Wash hands after use. Do not inhale dust.</p>",

These calcium blocks are packed with a highly Bioavailable calcium carbonate to ensure maximum absorbency in the gut. In the wild Tortoises would naturally seek out mineral rich rocks to scrap their beaks on. This would serve two functions, firstly to top up their calcium levels, and secondly to help prevent beak overgrowth. Instructions: Simply place the block into any enclosure with a Tortoise. The tortoise will naturally seek out the calcium block when it needs it. Most Reptiles and amphibians can absorb calcium from their food only in the presence of vitamin D3. It is essential that UVB light, of the correct wavelength and intensity, is provided to enable D3 synthesis or oral D3 is supplied. This is a natural product and is pack by hand. Every effort has been made to ensure it is free from contamination but there is a very low risk it may contain flint. Flint is easy to recognise and would appear solid black or brown compared to the white calcium carbonate. Ingredients: 100% Calcium Carbonate</p>",

A minimum tank size of 150L (40 gallons) is recommended for a small school of these fish.</li> <li>Provide a dark substrate, driftwood, and rock formations to mimic their natural environment. Avoid delicate plants, as they may damage them during feeding or swimming.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Water Parameters</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Bucktooth Tetras thrive in slightly acidic to neutral water conditions, with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.</li> <li>Maintain the water temperature between 24 to 28&deg;C (75 to 82&deg;F).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Filtration and Water Flow</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>These fish prefer moderate water flow. Use a strong filter to maintain clean, well-oxygenated water, as they produce a fair amount of waste.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diet</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Bucktooth Tetras are primarily carnivores and should be fed a diet of live or frozen foods like bloodworms, brine shrimp, and small feeder fish.</li> <li>Supplement with high-protein pellets or flakes to ensure a balanced diet.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Tank mates</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Bucktooth Tetras are aggressive and can be fin-nippers. They are best kept in a species-only tank or with similarly robust and fast-moving fish.</li> <li>Avoid housing them with smaller, slower, or long-finned fish that may become targets.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><strong>Behavior and Compatibility</strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Bucktooth Tetras are active and aggressive predators, often exhibiting schooling behavior when kept in groups of 6 or more.</li> <li>They thrive when kept in larger groups to minimize aggression toward tank mates and to encourage their natural schooling habits.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>",
